# Sparksammy Code of Conduct 1.025
We, overall, must follow one simple rule to each other: *Stay excellent to each other.* This includes but is not limited to:
* Using welcoming behavior and language.
* Do not cuss or use bad language unless you feel strongly about a subject
  * Basically: Do not abuse bad language
* No sexual behavior unless approved by the other person.
  * *Digital/Virtual hugs do not count.*
* Speaking English is a requirement so everyone understands each other.
* No DOXing
* No murderers and sexual predators that haven't done jail time yet are allowed here. Move on to another project.
* Samuel (Sparksammy) Lord can do whatever he wants.
  * This is just so that the owner (Samuel Lord) never gets kicked or banned from his own project[s].
* "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." --Steve Jobs

## About real names.
If you are comfortable going by your real name, that's great! If not, just go by your GitHub username. *If a user does not feel comfortable using their real name, don't use their real name.*

## About punishments.
If you get punished, your punishment will be decided depending on severity of the damage and/or what you did. For example: If you say a curse word that's uncalled for, you will be warned 3 times then kicked. But if you are a murderer and didn't go to jail, you are banned until you go to jail and your sentence is up.
