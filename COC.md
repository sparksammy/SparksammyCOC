# Sparksammy Code of Conduct 1.03
We, overall, must follow one simple rule to each other: *Stay excellent to each other.* This includes but is not limited to:
* Using welcoming behavior and language.
* Do not cuss or use bad language unless you feel strongly about a subject
  * Basically: Do not abuse bad language
* No sexual behavior unless approved by the other person.
  * *Digital/Virtual hugs do not count.*
* Speaking English is a requirement so everyone understands each other.
* No DOXing
* No murderers and sexual predators that haven't done jail time yet are allowed here. Move on to another project.
* Samuel (Sparksammy) Lord can do whatever he wants.
  * This is just so that the owner (Samuel Lord) never gets kicked or banned from his own project[s].
* The owner can do what they want, too. (If the owner is Sparksammy, then see above.)
* "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." --Steve Jobs

## About real names.
If you are comfortable going by your real name, that's great! If not, just go by your GitHub username. *If a user does not feel comfortable using their real name, don't use their real name.*

## About punishments.
If you get punished, your punishment will be decided depending on severity of the damage and/or what you did. For example: If you say a curse word that's uncalled for, you will be warned 3 times then kicked. But if you are a murderer and didn't go to jail, you are banned until you go to jail and your sentence is up.

## About Sparksammy
Samuel (Sparksammy) Lord, if the project is by Sparksammy, is the benevolent dictator for life of this, as well as any project made by him, unless said otherwise. However, if he doesn't own a project, he isn't the owner/benevolent dictator. Simple as that.
